Spring is a framework written in Java. Java projects can be built with some tools like Maven or Gradle. We will first look into Maven, then definition of Spring and Spring Boot. 

## Maven
Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build from a central piece of information. 

### POM (Project Object Model)


### Features
- simple project setup that follows best practices: Maven tries to avoid as much configuration as possible, by supplying project templates (named archetypes)
- dependency management: it includes automatic updating, downloading and validating the compatibility, as well as reporting the dependency closures (known also as transitive dependencies)
- isolation between project dependencies and plugins: with Maven, project dependencies are retrieved from the dependency repositories while any pluginâ€™s dependencies are retrieved from the plugin repositories, resulting in fewer conflicts when plugins start to download additional dependencies
- central repository system: project dependencies can be loaded from the local file system or public repositories, such as Maven Central (www.mvnrepository.com)
